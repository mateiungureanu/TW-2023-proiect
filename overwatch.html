                <h4>DIRECTOR'S TAKE - EMPOWERING TANKS IN MIDSEASON</h4>
                Hey, everyone! I'm glad to see all of you digging into Season 10. We've loved seeing you welcome our
                newest hero, Venture, and enjoy the Mirrorwatch event (playable now in the Arcade!). However, this week,
                I want to look ahead to our midseason update and discuss some changes we have on the way for the Tank
                role.
                <br><br>
                In Overwatch 2, tanks are the imposing heroes who take the brunt of the fight while enabling their
                teammates to secure eliminations. While tanks are a big target for opponents to focus on, many team
                comps aim to burn down a Tank's HP quickly, or they get moved around a lot from displacement abilities.
                We've received feedback that tanks can either feel like they get taken down too quickly in a fight or
                that they're impossible to take down.
                <br><br>
                So, our midseason update is going to help balance how many hits tanks can take to stay in the fight
                better. First, we're specifically buffing the Tank passive to have a 25% damage reduction from
                headshots, which should help cut down on being burst down in a fight. We're also increasing the
                knockback resistance for tanks from 30% to 50%, which should allow them to hold the front line a lot
                more and not feel as subjected to displacement abilities.
                <br><br>
                We're also making some global gameplay changes that impact tanks. One is that we're reverting the Armor
                damage reduction back to reducing five damage per projectile with up to a 50% maximum. This means heroes
                like Reaper or Tracer will have more work to do to take down heroes like Reinhardt. Heroes with high
                burst damage per projectile will still be effective but these kinds of Tanks have better means to
                counterplay that type of damage.
                <br><br>
                Next, we made a light change to our overall HP recovery passive that will enable mobile tanks to get
                back to the front lines faster: The health regeneration passive for all heroes will no longer recover 20
                HP per second out of combat but instead recover 10 Health + 5% of their maximum HP per second. This
                means a hero like Reinhardt will recover their health at 45 health per second in a Role Queue match.
                <br><br>
                Altogether, these changes should have an impact on some of the pain points our tank players are
                experiencing, as well as the balance of the game. I have a feeling we'll see a lot of movement in the
                meta over the remainder of Season 10.
                <br><br>
                In some more individual changes, Junker Queen is getting a buffed Commanding Shout, which will be
                activated even if you are channeling other abilities like Carnage or Rampage, and its cooldown is
                getting reduced to 12 seconds. This change should allow her to be more engaged in intense fights where
                you need to charge in more quickly.
                <br><br>
                With Wrecking Ball, we're seeing some creative play with the changes to his Grappling Claw; however, his
                ability to contribute to the fight is getting a small buff. The impact damage from a full-charged swing
                using Grappling Claw is getting increased from 50 to 60. Piledriver is increasing the enemy movement
                lockout from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds. And finally, Minefield will be a little more threatening, with
                explosion damage increased from 130 to 165 and knockback increased from 5 to 10 meters.
                <br><br>
                Additional changes coming this midseason include some light buffs for Junkrat, Echo, and Hanzo, but
                we'll reveal those when you can jump and take these changes for a test drive when the Midseason patch
                arrives on May 14. That's all for this week, everyone! Thanks for reading, and let's make a great game.

                <h4>DIRECTOR'S TAKE: ADDRESSING UNAPPROVED PERIPHERALS ON CONSOLES</h4>
                Hey everyone! Senior game producer Adam Massey and lead gameplay engineer Daniel Razza here, subbing in
                for Aaron this week. We're going to share some updates on fair play for console players in Overwatch 2
                regarding the issue of unapproved peripherals.
                <br><br>
                What are Unapproved Peripherals?<br>
                Our goal is for Overwatch 2 to be a great experience no matter what platform you play on. The game feels
                best when matches are close and competitive, and everyone plays on a level playing field. To help
                achieve this, we've tailored the game experience on console by adding console-specific features such as
                aim assist, which helps bridge the difference in precision of aim between a mouse and a controller.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, some players on console have been using devices that allow them to use a mouse and
                keyboard while tricking the console into thinking that the inputs are coming from a controller. While
                some use different peripherals for accessibility purposes, some players take advantage of aim assist
                while using peripherals that were never intended to benefit from this feature. For our purposes, we call
                these devices “unapproved peripherals.”
                <br><br>
                Today, we're going to look at how we detect the use of unapproved peripherals and the actions we're
                going to take to level the playing field for all players.
                <br><br>
                Detecting Unapproved Peripherals<br>
                Figuring out which players are using unapproved peripherals has been a challenge for us to overcome.
                These devices are designed in such a way that consoles are unaware of them, and often have
                anti-detection features designed to make them even more elusive to catch. We have been carefully
                studying these devices to ensure we have high confidence in our ability to detect who is using them.
                <br><br>
                While we won't go into specific detail on exactly how we detect these devices, we can say that our
                detection has already been in place for multiple seasons, passively gathering data for us to analyze.
                Now that we have gathered the data we need, we can finally talk about how we plan to deal with the use
                of these unapproved peripherals.
                <br><br>
                Based on our data from the past few seasons, usage of unapproved peripherals is highly apparent in
                high-ranked play, typically at Grand Master or Champion rank being the highest, while usage of
                unapproved peripherals between Bronze and Platinum ranks was very rare. For this reason, the actions we
                take will be primarily targeted to help ensure fair play at higher ranks.
                <br><br>
                A quick disclaimer on users with accessibility needs: it is important to us that Overwatch 2 be
                accessible to as many players as possible, and we want to recognize that for a few players, the use of
                an unapproved peripheral may be a necessary component of their controller setup. We have done our utmost
                to ensure that players with accessibility needs will be less likely to trigger our detection. If a
                player with accessibility needs is detected, we have tailored our actions so that these players will be
                able to continue playing Overwatch 2.
                <br><br>
                Removing Unapproved Peripherals from Competitive Play<br>
                Starting in Season 11, players who are detected using an unapproved peripheral on a console will be
                actioned in two phases.
                <br><br>
                The first time a player is detected, they will be restricted from Competitive on console for one week.
                Players will still have access to Quick Play during this time, and if they cease using the unapproved
                peripheral, the restriction will eventually expire, and they will be able to resume playing Competitive.
                <br><br>
                However, if the use of the unapproved peripheral continues, not only will the player be restricted from
                Competitive on console, but they will be forced to play with other mouse and keyboard players when
                playing in Quick Play for the entire season. Additionally, these players will no longer have access to
                the aim-assist feature. They are welcome to continue playing Overwatch 2, but they will be playing
                against players who use a similar control setup to their own.
                <br><br>
                Taking Immediate Action<br>
                What about the use of unapproved peripherals before Season 11? Over the next few weeks, there will be
                permanent account bans against players who are the most severe abusers of unapproved peripherals. These
                actions will be targeted towards high-ranked players who have been reported by others and who our data
                clearly shows are using an unapproved peripheral. A reminder that per our Blizzard In-Game Code of
                Conduct, automating any facet of the game or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is
                considered cheating.
                <br><br>
                For console players using these unapproved peripherals who do not want their account banned, the only
                way to evade these bans is to cease using an unapproved peripheral right now. There will be no other
                warnings!
                <br><br>
                The Future of Mouse and Keyboard for Console<br>
                We recognize that many players use unapproved peripherals to enable input devices they simply prefer
                overall. So, we have started discussing whether we can add official mouse-and-keyboard support to
                consoles in a way that doesn't give these players an unfair advantage over their controller
                counterparts. Right now, for Competitive, console players play in a separate pool from PC. So, in order
                to allow console players who would like to use a mouse and keyboard legitimately, we would make sure
                they would be able to play in Competitive matches only with other mouse-and-keyboard users and without
                the benefit of aim assist.
                <br><br>
                Final Thoughts<br>
                We are committed to making Overwatch 2 a fair game for everyone, regardless of what platform you play on
                or the input device you choose to use. These changes are a step in the direction of leveling the playing
                field for all players. We continue to evolve our detection and actions against unapproved peripherals
                and other means of unfair play. Keep an eye out for how our efforts are progressing in future Defense
                Matrix updates! Thanks for reading, and let's make a great game.
